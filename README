DESCRIPTION

This piece of code is for converting a binary file into a binary file
while changing from big/little endianess, or data type between char,
short, int, long, float, double or long double.
       
SYNOPSIS
       bin2bin [options]

OPTIONS
       -i input_file 

               Opens file input_file for input

       -iend le|be 

               Selects endiness of input file: le for little_endian,
               or be for big_endian

       -iprec si1|si2|si4|ui1|ui2|ui4|r4|r8 

               Selects the precision of input data. (s|u) is for
               signed vs unsigned. (i|r is for integer or
               float. (1|2|4|8) is the number of bytes. Standard
               32-bit float uses 4-bytes, while double precision, or
               64-bit float, uses 8-byte.

       -o output_file 

               Open file output_file for output

       -oend le|be 

               Select endiness of output file: le for little_endian,
               or be for big_endian

       -oprec si1|si2|si4|ui1|ui2|ui4|r4|r8 

               Selects the precision of output data. (s|u) is for
               signed vs unsigned. (i|r) is for integer or
               float. (1|2|4|8) is the number of bytes. Standard
               32-bit float uses 4-bytes, while double precision, or
               64-bit float, uses 8-byte.
